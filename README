This is a simple app that notifies you by vibrating and activating in your notification panel. It's just for a simple reminder. The purpose of this app is to add a timer to your phone that uses a very insignificant amount of RAM and memory.
I've tested this on Android 2.2.1, 2.3.7 and 4.0.3. Worked perfectly!

It's a pretty simple app and my sole purpose is for getting better skills in Java, app development, Android and Git. Thanks to anyone who uses / installs!
